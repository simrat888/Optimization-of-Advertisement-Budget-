Building an optimization model for advertising dataset:
A budget constraint restricting the total amount of money to be allocated among three different sources, i.e., TV, Radio, Newspaper
The total expenditure for each of the above mentioned sources should be less than or equal to the allotted budget
Finding an objective function to maximize sales
Optimization Models
Predict sales through different linear optimization methods:
Linear Regression 
Lasso Regression 
Ridge Regression 
Elastic Regression
Tools used: Scikit-Learn Linear model and PuLP library
Future Works
Add more media constraints in advertisement to get better results to maximize sales
Having a better understanding on customer needs or analyzing data to target an ideal customer results in maximizing sales
Scale across various industries and more complex problems in marketing and advertisement to achieve maximum sales
